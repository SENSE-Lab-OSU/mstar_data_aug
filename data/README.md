This is where data and data-loading commands go.

Run python get_data.py

This should download two folders, "phase_histories" and "recovered_coefficients" needed for now to produce images for augmentation by running "model/generate_aug_images.m". We are working on uploading complete end to end code, i.e. the code to generate the files in these folders using publicly available MSTAR data from the CD.
